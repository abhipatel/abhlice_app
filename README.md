# Wedding App

This is a very simple wedding website that I used for my own wedding in June 2015.

The app is still missing a few elements:
- Encrypted cookies for access to the site
- Additional tests

I am aiming to add these elements to the site plus some more fancy front end design to make it into a more detailed exmaple. However, right now I'm concentrating on a mobile educational gaming app. So, I've made this current version of the code public to demonstrate some basic Rails knowledge.
